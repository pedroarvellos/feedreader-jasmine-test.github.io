# feedreader-jasmine-test.github.io

Feedreader is a project developed by Udacity and provided, during the Advanced Front-End Nano Degree course, to be tested through the framework Jasmine (which is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code). The intention of this project is to demonstrate the ability of testing synchronous and asynchronous functions through Jasmine.

## How to use

Download the project directly or go to a specific folder and download it by git:

`git init` 

`git clone https://github.com/pedroarvellos/feedreader-jasmine-test.github.io.git`

This project has a jasmine folder. This folder has the necessary libs and a spec folder, which contains the suit tests.

The project can be opened in any text editor, for example: _Sublime Text_, _Visual Studio_,  _Atom_, etc. To execute the game, it can be opened the index.html file on the browser.

## How to test

When the index.html file is opened, the jasmine panel will appear automatically and all tests will be executed. 

If the tests don't run successfully, the jasmine panel will report error through the red color and a description of the errors will be displayed. In the other hand, if all pass, the panel will show the green color.
